# Hi there! I'm Alex, a Software Engineer at Northeastern University 👋

I'm a recent graduate from Northeastern University's Khoury College of Computer Sciences, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. During my time at Northeastern, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in the university's renowned co-op program, which allowed me to gain real-world experience working as a software engineer at several top-tier tech companies.

## My Passion for Technology 💻

From a young age, I've been fascinated by the power of technology to solve complex problems and improve people's lives. This passion led me to pursue a career in software engineering, where I can continuously learn and innovate while working on projects that make a meaningful impact.

## My Co-op Experience 🚀

Throughout my time at Northeastern, I completed three six-month co-op placements:

1. **Software Engineering Intern at Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: I worked on the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) team, contributing to the development of new features and optimizations for AWS's flagship compute service.

2. **Full Stack Developer at HubSpot**: As part of the Marketing Hub team, I collaborated with designers and product managers to build and maintain user-facing features for HubSpot's marketing automation platform.

3. **Machine Learning Engineer at NVIDIA**: I joined the AI Research team, where I worked on developing and implementing novel deep learning algorithms for computer vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation.

## My Skills and Interests 🧠

- **Programming Languages**: Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Web Development**: React, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS
- **Databases**: SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), NoSQL (MongoDB, DynamoDB)
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Keras
- **Cloud Computing**: AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, Git

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors 🌲, playing soccer with friends ⚽️, or diving into a good science fiction novel 📚.

## Let's Connect! 🤝

I'm always eager to learn from others and collaborate on exciting projects. Feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:alex@example.com), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-example/), or [GitHub](https://github.com/alex-example). I look forward to connecting with you!

> I have combined forces with Pranav for 2 challenging yet amazing years at eGain. He has delivered very high quality work for straight two years right off the bat. His biggest strength is his command on objects, dependency injections, and library management. His coding standards are very high for someone with his experience and Pranav is a natural problem solver. He's a think-twice-and-code-once kind of guy and has potential to become a Software Architect faster than usual.
